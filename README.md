# Family Calendar

A Nuxt.js application that displays events from multiple Google Calendar feeds in a beautiful, unified interface.

## Features

- 📅 Display events from multiple Google Calendar feeds
- 🎨 Color-coded events by calendar source
- 📱 Responsive design that works on all devices
- ⚡ Real-time calendar feed parsing
- 🔧 Easy configuration via JSON file

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

## Calendar Configuration

1. Create a `calendar-locations.json` file in the root directory
2. Add your Google Calendar ICS URLs following this format:

```json
{
  "calendars": [
    {
      "name": "Family Calendar",
      "url": "https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/your-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics",
      "color": "#4285f4"
    }
  ]
}
```

See `CALENDAR_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions on getting Google Calendar ICS URLs.

**Note:** The `calendar-locations.json` file is ignored by git for privacy. Each user needs to create their own configuration file.
