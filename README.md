## 🍓 Raspberry Pi Kiosk Setup

Transform your Raspberry Pi into a dedicated family calendar display! The included scripts will:

- ✅ Build for production
- ✅ Launch in full-screen kiosk mode
- ✅ Auto-refresh hourly
- ✅ Restart automatically if it crashes

### Quick Install on Raspberry Pi:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevin-larry-bauer/family-calendar/main/install-kiosk.sh | bash
```

See [RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md](RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

## Calendar Configuration

1. Create a `calendar-locations.json` file in the root directory
2. Add your Google Calendar ICS URLs following this format:

```json
{
  "calendars": [
    {
      "name": "Family Calendar",
      "url": "https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/your-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics",
      "color": "#4285f4"
    }
  ]
}
```

See `CALENDAR_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions on getting Google Calendar ICS URLs.

**Note:** The `calendar-locations.json` file is ignored by git for privacy. Each user needs to create their own configuration file.
